  [ "The « Wonder of the Western World » forms a tower in the heart of an immense bay invaded
    by the highest tides in Europe.  It was at the request of the Archangel Michel « chief
    of the celestial militia » that Aubert, Bishop of Avranches built and consecrated a small
    church on the 16th October 709. In 966 a community of Benedictines settled on the rock
    at the request of the Duke of Normandy and the pre-Romanesque church was built before
    the year one thousand.    UNESCO has classed the Mont Saint-Michel as a world heritage
    in 1979 and this mecca of tourism welcomes more than three million visitors a year",

    "The picturesque village on the lake with the same name owes its existence to the rich
    salt deposit of salt in the mountain of Hallstatt. 7000 years ago, as the prehistoric
     humans from Hallstatt began to take the salt from the salt mine who would of guessed,
     that this little village would give its name to a period in history – the Hallstatt period
    (800-400 BC). Rich findings in Hallstatt and the upper valley of Hallstatt gave this
    village international recognition; even today discoveries are still made in the salt
    mountain of Hallstatt.  Among the most beautiful places of interest are the oldest
    salt mine in the world and the ossuary in Hallstatt, a romantic boat ride on Lake
    Hallstatt, a trip to the breathtaking cave world in Obertraun and a visit to the Lake
    Gosau with the mighty Dachstein glacier. Additionally, Bad Goisern is popular in the
    summer with hikers and bikers. In winter guests are lured in by the ski areas of Dachstein
    West in Gosau and the Ski and Freeride Arena in neighboring Obertraun with perfect slope
    conditions. We wish you an unforgettable holiday in Hallstatt! ",
    "Ping'an Zhuang Village Terraces is the earliest and most developed terraced fields in
    Longsheng, and the most touristy one. The rice terraces there are the largest in scale.
    The village is well-equipped with modern service facilities, where dining, accommodation
    and transportation are very convenient with over 80 hostels and hotels available, with Li
    An Lodge and Longji Star Wish Resort being the two best.    The Ping'an Zhuang villagers
    live in three-story stilted houses raised on piles over the     surface of the ground.
    Outside the village, the terraced fields stretch from the bottom to the top of the mountains,
     which take on different looks seasonally. The terraced fields look like silver ribbons in
     spring, green waves in summer, golden towers in autumn and flying dragons in winter.",
    "The Sawyer Glaciers at the end of Tracy Arm may not be the most famous glaciers in Alaska,
    but many visitors find them to be the most dramatic. Framed by mountains on either side,
    the glaciers are often bathed in a light mist that amplifies the blue hue of the ice.
    Get to know the locals: The glaciers are home to black and brown bears, wolves, deer and
    moose. Look for seals and whales in the fjord's icy waters, and frequent bald eagle
    appearances overhead.  Check out the fjord's many icebergs from close up as the ship
    maneuvers around them. The texture and color of the ice is quite different from the
    smooth stuff you put in drinks!",
    "Svalbard is the northernmost tip of Europe and, a few military bases aside, its settlements
    are the northernmost permanently inhabited spots on the planet. Located between the 76° and
    81° parallels, they are far more northerly than any part of Alaska and all but a few of
    Canada's Arctic islands. In fact, they would be permanently locked in by ice if not for
    the moderating influence of the Gulf Stream, and it is this comparative warmth that makes
    them habitable. The islands cover a total of 62,050km2, the largest of which are
    Spitsbergen, Nordaustlandet and Edgeøya. The combined permanent population is less than
    3000, nearly all of which is concentrated in the main settlements of Longyearbyen and
    Barentsburg on Spitsbergen. The islands are governed by Sysselmann pa Svalbard, literally if slightly awkwardly
    translated into English as the Governor of Svalbard; this is not a single person, but the
    administrative team responsible for police, fire, rescue, and other public services on the
    islands.",
    "Seven weeks after the death of King Ludwig II in 1886, Neuschwanstein was opened to the
    public. The shy king had built the castle in order to withdraw from public life – now
    vast numbers of people came to view his private refuge. Today Neuschwanstein is one of the
    most popular of all the palaces and castles in Europe. Every year 1.4 million people visit
    the castle of the fairy-tale king. In the summer around 6,000 visitors a day stream through
    rooms that were intended for a single inhabitant.  The setting of Neuschwanstein could not
    be more idyllic. However, movement in the foundation area has to be continuously monitored,
    and the sheer rock walls must be repeatedly secured. The harsh climate also has a detrimental
    effect on the limestone façades, which will have to be renovated section by section over
    the next few years.",
    "The genesis of the Azores is found upon 1766 volcanoes, nine of which are still active.
    Underground, almost three hundred volcanic cavities, including caves, ravines and cracks,
    have been surveyed. The landscape is filled with dry calderas, craters lakes, fumaroles and
    thermal water springs. In the sea, there are submarine geothermal springs. The mountain of
    Pico, majestic and with an intact cone, appears to be protecting all this geological wealth.
    The volcanism of the archipelago impresses for its diversity and creates its own magnetism.
    It is a witness to the power of Nature, and the basis for very special experiences. ",
    "Zhangye's Danxia landscape has lots of precipitous red cliffs, most of which are several
    hundred meters high, and multicolored ridges of weathered strata, sometimes stretching to the
    horizon. These formations, sometimes smooth sometimes sharp, stand  out against the greens
    or grays of the plains , looking grand and magnificent, vigorous and virile.  Across the
    Danxia landscape zone, a kaleidoscope of numerous red rocky outcrops resemble weird
    and wonderful shapes like castles, cones, towers ; as well as humans, creatures, birds
    and beasts. Their peaks peeping through the mist and clouds, produce mirage-like scenery
    of fantastic mountains and pavilions.",
    "Victoria Falls presents a spectacular sight of awe-inspiring beauty and grandeur on the
    Zambezi River, forming the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe. It was described by the Kololo
    tribe living in the area in the 1800’s as ‘Mosi-oa-Tunya’ – ‘The Smoke that Thunders’.
    In more modern terms Victoria Falls is known as the greatest curtain of falling water in
    the world. Columns of spray can be seen from miles away as, at the height of the rainy
    season, more than five hundred million cubic meters of water per minute plummet over
    the edge, over a width of nearly two kilometers, into a gorge over one hundred meters below.
    The wide, basalt cliff over which the falls thunder, transforms the Zambezi from a placid
    river into a ferocious torrent cutting through a series of dramatic gorges.  Facing the
    Falls is another sheer wall of basalt, rising to the same height, and capped by mist-soaked
    rain forest. A path along the edge of the forest provides the visitor prepared to brave the
    tremendous spray, with an unparalleled series of views of the Falls."]
